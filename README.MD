# Pokemon Pack Weight and Value Analysis Description

This project focuses on analyzing the linear relationship between a Pokemon booster pack's weight and the value of its contents. 

## Disclimers

- This project is purely for enjoyment. All 36 packs had already been purchased before weighing or analyzing. I think pre-weighing in stores ruins the fun and excitement for everyone.

## Data Information

- There were 36 unsleeved Paradox Rift booster packs taken from the same booster display box in this analysis.
- The scale that was used was the "MAXUS Precision Pokcet Scale".
- The value of each individual card was found on TCGPLAYER.com, a trusted and widely used source.
- The values were recorded from TCGPLAYER.com on March 16, 2024. 
- The outliers were removed from the dataset before analysis (6 of the 36 datapoints).

## Analysis

- The correlation coefficient for a linear relationship between a pack's weight in grams and its value in dollars is 0.46.
- There is a moderately strong positive linear relationship between the pack's weight and the pack's value.

## Conclusion

- The pack's weight is usually a decent indicator of the pack's value, but is not always accurate.
- Moreover, it is certainly more fun and exciting for everyone to buy without weighing packs.
